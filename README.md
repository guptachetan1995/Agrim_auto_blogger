## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these instructions to set up and run BlogSmith AI on your local machine for development and testing.

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

-   [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v18.x or later recommended)
-   [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) or [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)
-   A **Google API Key** with access to a Gemini model (e.g., Gemini 1.5 Flash). You can obtain this from [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/) or Google Cloud Console.
-   A **Tavily API Key** from [Tavily AI](https://tavily.com/) for web research capabilities.

### Environment Variables

1.  Create a `.env` file in the root of your project by copying the `.env.example` file:
    ```bash
    cp .env.example .env
    ```
2.  Populate the `.env` file with your API keys:

    ```env
    # Required for Genkit to connect to Google AI models (e.g., Gemini)
    GOOGLE_API_KEY="your_google_api_key_here"

    # Required for the Tavily search service to fetch research material
    TAVILY_API_KEY="your_tavily_api_key_here"

    # Optional: Specify a specific Google Cloud project for Genkit if needed
    # GCLOUD_PROJECT="your_gcloud_project_id"
    ```

    -   `GOOGLE_API_KEY`: Your API key for Google AI services (Gemini).
    -   `TAVILY_API_KEY`: Your API key for the Tavily search service.

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone <repository-url>
    cd blogsmith-ai # Or your repository name
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    Using npm:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
    Or using yarn:
    ```bash
    yarn install
    ```

## ‡∂∞ Running the Application

### Development Mode

To run BlogSmith AI in development mode, you need to start two separate processes: the Next.js frontend server and the Genkit development server.

1.  **Start the Genkit Development Server:**
    Open a terminal and run:
    ```bash
    npm run genkit:watch
    ```
    This command uses `tsx` to transpile and run your TypeScript AI flows and Genkit configuration. The `--watch` flag enables automatic reloading when you modify files in the `src/ai/` directory. This will typically start the Genkit development UI on `http://localhost:4000`, where you can inspect, trace, and test your AI flows.

2.  **Start the Next.js Development Server:**
    Open another terminal and run:
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
    This will start the Next.js application, usually on `http://localhost:9002` (as configured in `package.json`).

You can now access BlogSmith AI in your browser at `http://localhost:9002`.

### Production Build

To build the application for production:

```bash
npm run build
```

This command transpiles your AI flows (if necessary for your deployment strategy) and creates an optimized Next.js production build in the `.next` folder.

### Starting the Production Server

After building, you can start the production server:

```bash
npm run start
```

This will serve the optimized application, typically on `http://localhost:3000` (or the port specified by the `PORT` environment variable).

**Important Note on Production Deployment:** In a true production environment, Genkit flows are ideally deployed as separate, scalable services (e.g., Google Cloud Functions, Cloud Run). The `genkit:watch` script is for local development convenience. For production, your build process should ensure the AI flows are correctly packaged or deployed, and your Next.js application should be configured to call these deployed flow endpoints (often via HTTP).

## üó∫Ô∏è User Journey

The user journey is designed to be simple and intuitive:

1.  **Input**: The user navigates to the BlogSmith AI application. They are presented with a clean form.
2.  **Parameters**: The user fills in the blog post parameters:
    *   **Blog Description**: A detailed overview of the desired blog topic.
    *   **Primary Keywords**: The main keywords the blog should focus on.
    *   **Secondary Keywords (Optional)**: Additional keywords for more nuanced content.

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1.  **User Input**: The user provides a blog description, primary keywords, optional secondary keywords, and the target audience through the web interface (`BlogForm`).
2.  **Frontend Request**: The Next.js frontend captures this input and sends it to a Server Action (`handleGenerateBlog` in `src/app/actions.ts`).
3.  **Genkit Orchestration**: The Server Action invokes the main Genkit flow, `generateBlogPostFlow` (defined in `src/ai/flows/generate-blog-post.ts`).
4.  **Research Phase (`researchBlogTopicFlow`):**
    *   **Intelligent Query Generation**: The `generateBlogPostFlow` first calls the `researchBlogTopicFlow` (defined in `src/ai/flows/research-blog-topic.ts`). This sub-flow uses an LLM (via `researchBlogTopicPrompt`) to intelligently generate a set of 2-3 relevant search queries based on the user's input. This step ensures that the subsequent web search is targeted and effective.
    *   **Web Search via Tavily**: The generated search queries are then passed to the `tavilySearch` service (in `src/services/tavily.ts`). This service makes API calls to the Tavily API, requesting advanced search results (including content snippets, titles, and URLs).
    *   **Source Collection & Deduplication**: Tavily returns a list of relevant web pages. The `researchBlogTopicFlow` collects these sources and de-duplicates them based on URL to ensure variety.
    *   **Research Output**: This flow returns an object containing the search queries used and a list of unique, relevant `TavilySearchResult` objects (each containing title, URL, content snippet, and score) to the main `generateBlogPostFlow`.
5.  **Content Generation Phase (`generateBlogPostPrompt` within `generateBlogPostFlow`):**
    *   **Comprehensive Prompt Engineering**: The `generateBlogPostFlow` now prepares a detailed prompt for the primary LLM (Gemini). This prompt is critical and includes:
        *   The original user input (description, keywords, audience).
        *   The curated "Research Material" (the `searchResults` array of `TavilySearchResult` objects from the research phase).
        *   Specific, explicit instructions on how to write the blog post:
            *   **Tone & Style**: Human-like, fluent, conversational, authoritative, and tailored to the target audience.
            *   **Content Integration**: **Critically use and synthesize information** from the provided "Research Material". Prioritize these sources for facts and recent developments.
            *   **Structure & Length**: Logical flow, clear introduction, body paragraphs with headings (H2, H3), and a conclusion. Aim for a substantial word count (e.g., 500-800 words).
            *   **Hyperlinking**: **Naturally embed 2-3 relevant hyperlinks** to the source URLs from the "Research Material". Use the source titles or relevant phrases from the content as anchor text. This is crucial for authenticity and providing verifiable references. The prompt guides the LLM on how to format these as `<a>` tags.
            *   **Formatting**: Output valid HTML (paragraphs, headings, lists). Exclude `<html>`, `<body>`, etc. No `<img>` tags.
            *   **SEO**: Implicitly guided through keyword usage and good structure, but can be explicitly prompted.
            *   **Originality**: Emphasize summarizing, synthesizing, and citing (by linking); strictly avoid plagiarism.
    *   **LLM Invocation**: The meticulously crafted prompt is sent to the configured Gemini model via Genkit.
    *   **Blog Output**: The LLM generates the blog post title and its main content in HTML format, with research-backed information and embedded hyperlinks as instructed.
6.  **Response to Frontend**: The generated title and HTML content are returned by the Server Action to the Next.js frontend.
7.  **Display to User**: The frontend component (`BlogDisplay`) renders the HTML content using `dangerouslySetInnerHTML`, showcasing the AI-generated blog post with its research-backed insights and active hyperlinks.
8.  **User Feedback (Optional Enhancement)**: The user can interact with feedback buttons. This data could be sent to another Genkit flow like `summarizeUserFeedback` for analysis and potential future model fine-tuning or prompt adjustments.

This structured, research-first approach allows BlogSmith AI to move beyond simple text generation. It actively gathers relevant, up-to-date information and then strategically uses that information to craft a high-quality, authentic, and well-referenced blog post, significantly enhancing the "human-like" and "well-researched" qualities of the output.

## ü§ñ AI / Genkit Integration Details

The intelligence of BlogSmith AI is powered by its robust Genkit integration:

-   **`src/ai/genkit.ts`**: Initializes the global Genkit `ai` object. It configures essential plugins, notably `googleAI()`, enabling Genkit to communicate with Google's Gemini models. The default model (e.g., `gemini-2.0-flash` or `gemini-1.5-flash`) is set here.
-   **`src/ai/flows/`**: This directory contains the definitions for individual Genkit flows.
    -   **`research-blog-topic.ts`**:
        -   Defines `researchBlogTopicFlow`.
        -   Accepts `ResearchBlogTopicInput` (blog description, keywords, audience).
        -   Utilizes `researchBlogTopicPrompt` to instruct an LLM to generate targeted search queries.
        -   Calls the `tavilySearch` service (from `src/services/tavily.ts`) with these queries.
        -   Returns `ResearchBlogTopicOutput`, which includes the generated search queries and an array of `TavilySearchResult` objects (containing titles, URLs, content snippets, and relevance scores).
    -   **`generate-blog-post.ts`**:
        -   Defines `generateBlogPostFlow` (the main flow).
        -   Accepts `GenerateBlogPostInput` (user's initial request).
        -   **Crucially, it first invokes `researchBlogTopicFlow`** to obtain up-to-date research material.
        -   It then constructs `GenerateBlogPostPromptInputSchema` by combining the user's original input with the `searchResults` (an array of `TavilySearchResult`) from the research step.
        -   The `generateBlogPostPrompt` is heavily engineered with detailed instructions for the LLM. It specifies:
            -   Desired style, tone, length, and SEO considerations.
            -   HTML formatting requirements (paragraphs, headings, lists).
            -   **Explicit instructions on how to integrate the research material (titles, snippets) and embed hyperlinks (`<a>` tags) to the actual source URLs.** This is key for authenticity.
        -   Returns `GenerateBlogPostOutput` (blog title and the full HTML content).
-   **`src/ai/types.ts`**: Houses Zod schemas that define the expected structure and data types for inputs and outputs of all AI flows and prompts (e.g., `GenerateBlogPostInputSchema`, `TavilySearchResultSchema`, `GenerateBlogPostOutputSchema`). This ensures data integrity and provides strong typing throughout the AI logic.
-   **Server Actions (`src/app/actions.ts`)**: The Next.js frontend communicates with these Genkit flows via Server Actions. For example, `handleGenerateBlog` is a Server Action that takes validated form data, invokes the `generateBlogPostFlow`, and returns the AI-generated blog post to the client for display.

## üåê External Services Integration

-   **Tavily AI (`src/services/tavily.ts`)**: This module encapsulates the logic for interacting with the Tavily Search API. The `tavilySearch` function:
    -   Accepts a search query and an optional maximum number of results.
    -   Constructs the API request to Tavily, including the API key from environment variables.
    -   Specifies parameters like `search_depth: 'advanced'` for comprehensive results and `include_raw_content: false` (as content snippets are usually sufficient and more concise for the LLM).
    -   Handles API responses robustly, including potential errors.
    -   Transforms the Tavily API response into an array of `TavilySearchResult` objects, a standardized format used throughout the application.

## üé® Styling and UI

-   **Tailwind CSS**: The primary styling engine, configured in `tailwind.config.ts`. Utility classes are used extensively for rapid and consistent UI development.
-   **ShadCN UI Theme**: The application utilizes a custom theme for ShadCN UI components. This theme is defined using CSS HSL variables in `src/app/globals.css`. This allows for easy customization of the color palette (background, foreground, primary, accent, destructive, etc.) for both light and dark modes, adhering to the style guidelines (Neutral white/light gray, Light blue/green links, Teal accent).
-   **Google Fonts (Geist)**: The `Geist Sans` and `Geist Mono` fonts are used for clean and modern typography, configured in `src/app/layout.tsx`.
-   **Responsive Design**: The UI is designed to be responsive and adapt to various screen sizes, leveraging Tailwind's responsive prefixes (e.g., `sm:`, `md:`, `lg:`).
-   **Prose Styling**: The `@tailwindcss/typography` plugin is used to provide sensible default styling for the HTML content generated by the AI, ensuring readability (applied in `BlogDisplay` component).

## ‚úÖ Linting and Type Checking

-   **ESLint**: Configured for code linting to maintain code quality and consistency. Run `npm run lint` to check for linting errors.
-   **TypeScript**: Used for static type checking across the project, enhancing code reliability. Run `npm run typecheck` to ensure type safety.

## üöÄ Deployment Considerations

To deploy this Next.js application effectively, consider the following:

-   **Platform Choice**:
    -   [Vercel](https://vercel.com/): Highly recommended for Next.js applications due to its seamless integration, optimization features, and support for Server Actions and Edge Functions.
    -   [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/): Another excellent platform for modern web applications.
    -   [Google Cloud Run](https://cloud.google.com/run) / [Google Cloud Functions](https://cloud.google.com/functions): Suitable for deploying both the Next.js app and the Genkit flows as separate, scalable services.
    -   Self-hosting on a Node.js server or Docker container.
-   **Environment Variables**: Ensure all necessary environment variables (`GOOGLE_API_KEY`, `TAVILY_API_KEY`) are securely configured in your deployment environment's settings. **Do NOT commit your `.env` file to version control.** Use the `.env.example` as a template.
-   **Genkit Flow Deployment (Production)**:
    -   For production, Genkit flows should ideally be deployed as independent, callable HTTP endpoints (e.g., as Firebase Cloud Functions or Google Cloud Run services).
    -   Your Next.js application's Server Actions would then make authenticated HTTP requests to these deployed flow endpoints instead of calling them directly as local TypeScript functions. This decouples the AI backend from the frontend application and allows for independent scaling and management of the AI logic.
    -   The `genkit deploy` command (part of the Genkit CLI) can assist in deploying flows to supported platforms. Consult Genkit documentation for platform-specific deployment guides.
-   **Build Process**: Your deployment pipeline should include `npm run build` to create an optimized Next.js build. If deploying Genkit flows separately, ensure they are also built and deployed according to their respective platform requirements.
-   **Database (Optional for Future Extensions)**: If you plan to store generated blogs, user feedback, user accounts, or other persistent data, you'll need to integrate a database (e.g., Firebase Firestore, Supabase, PostgreSQL, MongoDB).
